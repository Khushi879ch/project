## Deliverables

-`Project(2).ipynb` – Full Python EDA notebook
- YouTube_Dashboard.pbix` – Power BI interactive dashboard
- README.md` – Project walkthrough
- Project_Report.pdf` – Clean summary for internship submission

The dataset contains trending video data from:
- 🇺🇸 US
- 🇮🇳 India
- 🇨🇦 Canada
- 🇦🇺 Australia
- 🇬🇧 Great Britain

**Key columns**:
- `video_id`, `title`, `channelTitle`
- `category`, `publish_time`, `views`, `likes`, `dislikes`, `comment_count`
- `region` (added during preprocessing)
</details>

## Objectives

- Understand **which categories** perform best on YouTube
- Compare **regional trends** in content consumption
- Identify **top-performing channels**
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** with filters, visuals, and KPIs

## Analysis Workflow

## 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed nulls, fixed dtypes, renamed columns
- Combined 5 regional datasets into 1 master dataset
- Extracted `publish_date`, `publish_hour`, `day_of_week`

## 2. EDA in Python
- Visualized **views by category**
- Bar charts for **top channels**
- Regional comparison of **likes/comments/views**
- Heatmap of **trending hours vs days**

## 3. Dashboard in Power BI
Included:
-  **Pie Chart** – Top channels by views
-  **Bar Chart** – Top categories globally
-  **Map View** – Views by region
-  **KPI Cards** – Total views, likes, comments
-  **Slicers** – Region and category filters

## Key Insights

Gaming is the most viewed category across all countries  
Channel 4 and Channel 9are the most consistent performers  
Canada and Great Britain had the highest average views per video  
Peak engagement is usually in the evening hours, mid-week
